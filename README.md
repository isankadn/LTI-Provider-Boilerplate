# LTI Application Boilerplate

This repository contains boilerplate code for developing an LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) application that integrates with Moodle as an LTI Provider.

## Overview

The LTI Application Boilerplate provides a starting point for building an external tool or application that can be integrated into Moodle using the LTI standard. It includes the necessary components and configurations to facilitate the integration process.

## Components

The boilerplate code consists of the following main components:

1. **LTI Provider**: The LTI Provider component represents the external tool or application that provides the learning content, activities, or services to be integrated into Moodle. It handles the communication with Moodle and delivers the necessary functionality.

2. **LTI Consumer**: The LTI Consumer component represents the Moodle system that consumes or integrates the LTI Provider's content or services. It manages the integration process and presents the LTI Provider's functionality within the Moodle interface.

## Getting Started

To start developing your LTI application using this boilerplate code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/isankadn/LTI-Provider-Boilerplate.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies and set up the development environment.
3. Configure the LTI Provider settings, such as the endpoint URLs and authentication credentials.
4. Implement the desired functionality for your LTI application within the LTI Provider component.
5. Set up the LTI Consumer (Moodle) to integrate with your LTI Provider by configuring the necessary settings and credentials.
6. Test the integration to ensure proper communication and functionality between the LTI Provider and LTI Consumer.
